# MapReduce Project

This is the final project for the MapReduce section of Jesse Anderson's Professional
Data Engineering course. 

I decided to use a different data source than the previous examples, and found 
this data set which lists Movies and their genres here:  
https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

The MapReduce java code for this project can be found in the src/main/java/finalproj.  
The models that resulted from my use of Avro schemas can be found in finalproj.model.
